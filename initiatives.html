  <h3>UDAAN</h3>

In the past it has contributed towards the upliftment of the underprivileged through the conduction of various educational workshop and innovational programs.
During their vacations, students from IIT Guwahati and several other colleges conducted Udaan where they reached out to various underprivileged children from orphanages, villages and slums in their locality, and spared a weekend to give flights to their hopes with the help of various documentaries, presentations, games and motivation. 
<br><br>
Udaan reached 52 cities across India in 2015. Our mission is to rewrite the pages of underprivileged children, to reach out to them and to adorn their lives with some wonderful moments. In 2017, under the banner of Udaan, Alcheringa in association with CRY (Child Rights and You) NGO, organised the national level campaign ‘Desh Ka Sandesh’ - An event conducted across government schools in different cities in India where children were asked to write and paint messages of love and encouragement for the Indian Army, to honour their valour, sacrifice and unwavering commitment towards the country.
